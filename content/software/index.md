**bmgs**</br>
<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">An R package for Bayesian analysis of graphical models for binary and/or ordinal variables. Can be downloaded from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=bgms">cran</a>. More details about the package can be found on the bgms <a href="https://maartenmarsman.github.io/bgms/">Github page</a>, and development versions can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/MaartenMarsman/bgms">Github repository</a>.</p>

**easybgm**</br> 
<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">
An R package that streamlines Bayesian analysis of graphical models and simplifies related output (e.g., plotting functions). Can be installed from the easybgm <a href="https://github.com/KarolineHuth/easybgm">Github repository</a>. More details about the package can also be found there.</p>

**rbinnet**</br>
<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify"> An R-package for the Bayesian analysis of graphical models for binary variables. Can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/MaartenMarsman/rbinnet">Github repository</a>. Has been superseded by the bgms package.

**JASP**</br>
<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">JASP is an open-source statistical software program that comes with a graphical user interface, that can be downloaded from <a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">here</a>. In JASP, users can load their own data and point-and-click to select their desired analysis. It includes both frequentist and Bayesian versions of the most common statistical analysis, including network analysis. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ub5tc">Here</a> is a tutorial of the Bayesian analysis of graphical models in JASP.
