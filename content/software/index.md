**easybgm**</br> 
<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">An R package that streamlines Bayesian analysis of graphical models and simplifies related output (e.g., plotting functions). Can be downloaded from <a href = "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=easybgm">cran</a>. More details about the package can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/KarolineHuth/easybgm">Github repository</a>, and development versions can also be downloaded from there.</p>

<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">JASP is an open source statistical software program with a graphical user interface that can be downloaded from <a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">here</a>. In JASP, users can load their own data and point and click to select their desired analysis. It includes both frequentist and Bayesian versions of the most common statistical analyses, including network analysis. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ub5tc">Here</a> is a tutorial on Bayesian analysis of graphical models in JASP.</p>
