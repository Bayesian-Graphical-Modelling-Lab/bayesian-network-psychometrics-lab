<p style="font-size: medium">The Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab devotes itself to creating a Bayesian methodology for analyzing graphical models. In psychology, graphical models are used to characterize dynamical systems of interacting psychological variables. Since this network structure is usually unknown to us we need to infer it from empirical data. This process is inherently uncertain. The Bayesian approach offers a principled procedure to reason with this uncertainty, expressing the plausibility of various network structures for the data at hand, determining the statistical evidence for edge in- and exclusion, and offering robust predictive intervals for the network's parameters. These are only a few of several concrete advantages the Bayesian approach has to offer, and that allows us to analyze graphical models with confidence. The Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab dedicates itself to opening up these advantages to end-users through open-access publications, open-source statistical software in the form of R packages, and by incorporating it into the free, user-friendly JASP program.</p>
