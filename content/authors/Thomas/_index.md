# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
#bio: My research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter.

After starting my career in a purely clinical setting, I decided to join the French network of Expert Centers in Psychiatry (established by the Fundamental Foundation) as a way to integrate my clinical practice into a framework of fundamental and applied research. My interest in research also led me to pursue a PhD program, where I investigate the influence of biological, psychological, and clinical factors on cognition in psychiatric disorders. I explore these relationships using psychometric network models.
