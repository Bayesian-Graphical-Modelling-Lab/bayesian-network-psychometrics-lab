  abstract = {The Ising model is one of the most widely analyzed graphical models in network psychometrics. However, popular approaches to parameter estimation and structure selection for the Ising model cannot naturally express uncertainty about the estimated parameters or selected structures. To address this issue, this paper offers an objective Bayesian approach to parameter estimation and structure selection for the Ising model. Our methods build on a continuous spike-and-slab approach. We show that our methods consistently select the correct structure and provide a new objective method to set the spike-and-slab hyperparameters. To circumvent the exploration of the complete structure space, which is too large in practical situations, we propose a novel approach that first screens for promising edges and then only explore the space instantiated by these edges. We apply our proposed methods to estimate the network of depression and alcohol use disorder symptoms from symptom scores of over 26,000 subjects.},

  abstract = {Alcohol use disorder is argued to be a highly complex disorder influenced by a multitude of factors on different levels. Common research approaches fail to capture this breadth of interconnecting symptoms. To address this gap in theoretical assumptions and methodological approaches, we used a network analysis to assess the interplay of alcohol use disorder symptoms. We applied the exploratory analysis to two US-datasets, a population sample with 23,591 individuals and a clinical sample with 483 individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder. Using a Bayesian framework, we first investigated differences between the clinical and population sample looking at the symptom interactions and underlying structure space. In the population sample the time spent drinking alcohol was most strongly connected, whereas in the clinical sample loss of control showed most connections. Furthermore, the clinical sample demonstrated less connections, however, estimates were too un\- stable to conclude the sparsity of the network. Second, for the population sample we assessed whether the network was measurement invariant across external factors like age, gender, ethnicity and income. The network differed across all factors, especially for age subgroups, indicating that subgroup specific networks should be considered when deriving implications for theory building or intervention planning. Our findings corroborate known theories of alcohol use disorder stating loss of control as a central symptom in alcohol dependent individuals.},

  abstract = {The Ising model is a graphical model that has played an essential role in network psychometrics. It has been used as a theoretical model to conceptualize psychological concepts and as a statistical model to analyze psychological data. Using graphical models such as the Ising model to analyze psychological data has been heavily critiqued since these data often come from cross-sectional applications. An often voiced concern is the inability of the Ising model to express heterogeneity in the population. The idiographic approach has been posed as an alternative and aims to infer individual network structures. While idiographic networks overcome population heterogeneity, it is unclear how they aggregate into established cross-sectional phenomena. This paper establishes a formal bridge between idiographic and cross-sectional network approaches of the Ising model. We ascertain unique topological structures that characterize individuals and aggregate into an Ising model crosssectionally. This new formulation supports population heterogeneity while being consistent with cross-sectional phenomena. The proposed theory also establishes a new statistical framework for analyzing populations of idiographic networks for binary variables. The Ising model and the divide and color model are special cases of this new framework. We introduce a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate models from this new framework.},

  abstract = {In recent years, network models have been proposed as an alternative representation of psychometric constructs such as depression. In such models, the covariance between observables (e.g., symptoms like depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, and guilt) is explained in terms of a pattern of causal interactions between these observables, which contrasts with classical interpretations in which the observables are conceptualized as the effects of a reflective latent variable. However, few investigations have been directed at the question how these different models relate to each other. To shed light on this issue, the current paper explores the relation between one of the most important network models\textemdash the Ising model from physics\textemdash and one of the most important latent variable models\textemdash the Item Response Theory (IRT) model from psychometrics. The Ising model describes the interaction between states of particles that are connected in a network, whereas the IRT model describes the probability distribution associated with item responses in a psychometric test as a function of a latent variable. Despite the divergent backgrounds of the models, we show a broad equivalence between them and also illustrate several opportunities that arise from this connection.},

  abstract = {Researchers frequently wish to assess the equality or inequality of groups, but this comes with the challenge of adequately adjusting for multiple comparisons. Statistically, all possible configurations of equality and inequality constraints can be uniquely represented as partitions of the groups, where any number of groups are equal if they are in the same partition. In a Bayesian framework, one can adjust for multiple comparisons by constructing a suitable prior distribution over all possible partitions. Inspired by work on variable selection in regression, we propose a class of flexible beta-binomial priors for Bayesian multiple comparison adjustment. We compare this prior setup to the Dirichlet process prior suggested by Gopalan and Berry (1998) and multiple comparison adjustment methods that do not specify a prior over partitions directly. Our approach to multiple comparison adjustment not only allows researchers to assess all pairwise (in)equalities, but in fact all possible (in)equalities among all groups. As a consequence, the space of possible partitions grows quickly \textemdash{} for ten groups, there are already 115,975 possible partitions \textemdash{} and we set up a stochastic search algorithm to efficiently explore the space. Our method is implemented in the Julia package EqualitySampler, and we illustrate it on examples related to the comparison of means, variances, and proportions.},
