The Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab is continually developing new ideas and projects, creating an ideal environment for (masterâ€™s) students to enhance their skills through internships or thesis work. Students typically contribute to an aspect of an ongoing project by programming, performing analyses, and conducting quality checks on the developed methods. Additionally, the lab houses a relatively large repository of empirical datasets from published research employing cross-sectional network analysis; these datasets can be utilized for evaluating the methods developed in our lab.
