<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">The Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab consists of an enthusiastic group of researchers who are constantly developing new graphical models and novel methods for analyzing them. This provides an ideal environment for students to hone their statistical and methodological skills through internships or theses. Student projects typically contribute to an ongoing project in the lab and typically involve programming new methods, performing analyses, and performing quality checks on new methods.</p>

<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">Below is an overview of the research areas in which we typically have projects available in our lab. Please note that these are general categories, not specific projects. If you are interested in a research project in one of these areas, please contact one of the associated researchers!</p>
