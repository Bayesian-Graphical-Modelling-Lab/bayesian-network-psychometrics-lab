<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">The Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab consists of an enthusiastic group of researchers who are constantly developing new graphical models and novel methods for analyzing them. This provides an ideal environment for students to hone their statistical and methodological skills through internships or theses. Student projects typically contribute to an ongoing project in the lab and typically involve programming new methods, performing analyses, and performing quality checks on new methods.</p>

<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">Below is an overview of the research areas in which we typically have projects available in our lab. Please note that these are general categories, not specific projects. If you are interested in a research project in one of these areas, please contact one of the associated researchers!</p>

- Develop graphical models of psychological data or analyze their properties (e.g., their dynamics).

- Projects that demonstrate the Bayesian approach to graphical modeling, i.e. create demos or vignettes, but also tutorials and guidelines. <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/nikola-sekulovski/">Nikola Sekulovski</a>, & Johnny van Doorn

- Re-analyze existing data using Bayesian graphical models. <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/jonas-haslbeck/">Jonas Haslbeck</a>, & <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/nikola-sekulovski/">Nikola Sekulovski</a>
