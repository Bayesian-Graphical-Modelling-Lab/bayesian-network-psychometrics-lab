<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">The Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab consists of an enthusiastic group of researchers who are constantly developing new graphical models and novel methods for analyzing them. This provides an ideal environment for students to hone their statistical and methodological skills through internships or theses. Student projects typically contribute to an ongoing project in the lab and typically involve programming new methods, performing analyses, and performing quality checks on new methods.</p>

<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">Below is an overview of the research areas in which we typically have projects available in our lab. Please note that these are general categories, not specific projects. If you are interested in a research project in one of these areas, please contact one of the associated researchers!</p>

- Projects focused on programming and evaluating the performance of various MCMC algorithms through convergence diagnostics. Coordinator: <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/maarten-marsman/">Maarten Marsman</a>.

- Projects centered on eliciting prior distributions, testing edge inclusion, and examining hypotheses on the network structure. Coordinator: <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/nikola-sekulovski/">Nikola Sekulovski</a>.

- Projects involving modeling and (pseudo)likelihood estimation. Coordinator: <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/giuseppe-arena/">Giuseppe Arena</a>.

- Projects related to time-series data or exploring higher-order interactions in networks. Coordinator: <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/jonas-haslbeck/">Jonas Haslbeck</a>

- Projects related to developing documentation and tutorials. Coordinator: <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/nikola-sekulovski/">Nikola Sekulovski</a>.
