<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify"> The <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/re-analysis/">Bayesian Re-analysis Project</a> aims to assess the robustness of psychological networks. To achieve this goal, the project collects the data used in published cross-sectional network analyses and reanalyzes each dataset using standardized frequentist and Bayesian procedures. How robust are frequentist network results? What are the patterns in the structure of psychological networks? On the one hand, the project aims to demonstrate the advantages of the Bayesian approach to network analysis, and on the other hand, it aims to answer the field's burning questions about the structure of psychological networks. </p> #The project is led by PhD student <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/karoline-huth/">Karoline Huth</a>, postdoctoral researcher <a href="https://jonashaslbeck.com/">Jonas Haslbeck</a>, and Assistant Professor <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/maarten-marsman/">Maarten Marsman</a>.
