**The Bayesian Reanalysis Project**</br>
<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify"> The <a href="https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/re-analysis/">Bayesian Re-analysis  Project</a> aims to assess the robustness of psychological networks. To achieve this goal, the project collects the data used in published cross-sectional network analyses and reanalyzes each dataset using standardized frequentist and Bayesian procedures. How robust are frequentist network results? What are the patterns in the structure of psychological networks? On the one hand, the project aims to demonstrate the advantages of the Bayesian approach to network analysis, and on the other hand, it aims to answer the field's burning questions about the structure of psychological networks. </p>

**The Brain - Behavior Network Project**</br> 
<p style="font-size:medium;text-align:justify">Network science has provided many insights into brain and behavioral function, but mostly in parallel. The Brain-Behavior Network Project aims to improve our understanding of brain-behavior interactions by integrating brain and behavioral networks. To achieve this goal, we use a Bayesian hierarchical approach that models the connection between graphical models using random graphs. This allows us to bridge the gap between idiographic (individual) and cross-sectional networks and to integrate brain and behavioral networks. We validate our model in a large ADHD cohort. The project is led by Assistant Professor <a href = "https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/author/maarten-marsman/">Maarten Marsman</a>, Assistant Professor Anouk Schrantee, and Postdoctoral Researcher Tessa Blanken.</p>
